VWCP: VolksComputer
===================

A Raspberry Pi car computer project.

Minus a lot of detail, the idea is to have a touch screen LCD display mounted
on the dash of the car or somewhere else, connected to a RPI 3 running the software.
A UI will be built from scratch (mostly), with 25% of the screen used for vehicle
stats, such as speed indicator, turn signal indicators, etc. The other 75% will be
used for other applications, such as a GPS. Obviously inspired by Tesla's software and
UIs.

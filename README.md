#VolksCarputer (VWCP)

"The People's Carputer"

The VolksCarputer (VWCP), a Raspberry Pi Carputer (Head Unit/Infotainment) project for my Volkswagen car.

Minus a lot of detail, the idea is to have a touch screen LCD display mounted
on the dash of the car or somewhere else, connected to a RPI 3 running the software.
OpenAuto will be used, allowing an Android phone to be plugged in and the display will
show an Android Auto UI complete with Google Maps, music, etc.
A UI will be built from scratch with a splash screen leading to a dashboard. The dashboard
will display various stats, app icon buttons which point to other programs, a homemade music
dashboard/player, and an icon button pointing to the OpenAuto program.

This project is designed for my own car but could (with probably some modification) be adapted for other vehicles.
